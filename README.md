# NumTheFun-website
Practicing TypeScript and Python

In this project I'm going to get some practice in for using TS and Python before some interviews next week. My plan is as thus:

## Current Plan
- [ ] Make NumTheFun interactable-with on a web page:
  - [x] Use Typescript to get a basic website running using the VSCode Extention, Live Server
  - [ ] Recreate my NumTheFun program in Python

## How to run
```
npm run build
// open dist/index.html in borwser (or right-click the file and select "Open with Live Server")
```

## Citations
Some help from [this blog][1] to remind how to get the basics running.
